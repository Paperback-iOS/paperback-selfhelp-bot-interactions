      For recently released media, this is extra strict to allow everyone the time to catch up. However, there is no specified length for how long this period is.

      A very relative term, but we do not consider bits of knowledge the average person should have learned as spoilers. Just keep in mind that not everyone might be aware; it doesn't take much to mark as a spoiler.

      Media that relies on single-chapter entertainment is also susceptible to spoiling; please keep this in mind. As with everything, itâ€™s up to each moderator to judge to the best of their ability.
