    1. **Use common sense**, respect everyone in the server.
    2. **Don't Advertise.** You can chat about other servers as long as it fits the topic.
    3. **Keep it English and SFW.** We're not an NSFW server and we don't tolerate it any of our channels.
    4. **Do not bypass the blacklisted word filter.** We've placed major derogatory terms under a filter, don't try to bypass it.
    5. **Keep the conversations in their appropriate channels.** Look at channel descriptions for an idea.
    6. **Do not ping/DM anyone without a valid reason.** Asking for support is not a valid reason.
    7. **If a Mod asks you to stop, STOP.** They have full right to mute you if you keep insisting.
    
    *You **agree** to comply with the server rules and channel guidelines, regardless if you have read them in their entirety. 
    This also includes the [Discord Terms of Services](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).*
