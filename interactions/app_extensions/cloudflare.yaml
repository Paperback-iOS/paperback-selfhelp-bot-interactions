      If you're having trouble accessing a source due to Cloudflare, here's a workaround:

      1. Open the "Discover" tab in Paperback and scroll to the third-party source you want to use.
      2. Press the cloud icon next to the source's name.
      3. The source should now load without issue.

      Note that this method may not work for all sources and may require multiple attempts. Additionally, we do not condone or encourage the use of this method for any malicious purposes.
