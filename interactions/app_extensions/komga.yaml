      Komga is a self-hosted comic/manga server. So you run the Komga software on your own PC/server to serve your own files. And then enter the IP of your server into Paperback. 
      It is important that you read everything. Paperback will not help you set up a Komga server.
      Every information is available here: https://komga.org/
