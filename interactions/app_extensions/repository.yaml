      Please note that Paperback does not hotlink to third-party repositories. You are responsible for finding the correct repository yourself. You can use Google or other search engines to find it, but we cannot provide support in finding third-party repositories.

      To add a repository, follow these steps:
      1. Find the repository you want to install.
      2. Copy the repository link.
      3. Open the app and navigate to the Source tab.
      4. Click on "Edit" and then "+"
      5. Paste the repository link in the appropriate field.

  - name: "**Adding Sources**"
    value: |
      To add sources, you will need to open the repository you just installed. Please note that sources are specific to each repository, and you cannot install them outside of the repository.

      We recommend that you only install up to 10 third-party sources at once, as having too many sources can cause performance issues and slow down the app.

  - name: "**Source Settings**"
    value: |
      Some third-party sources support language filtering. To change the language filter settings for a specific third-party source, follow these steps:
      1. Navigate to the External Source tab.
      2. Click on the Third Party Source you want to configure.
      3. Click on "Content Settings" and then select the desired language filter setting.
      Note that if you do not see the language filter settings, it means that the third-party source does not support this feature.
