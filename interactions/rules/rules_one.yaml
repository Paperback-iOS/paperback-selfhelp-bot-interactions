    Respect everyone on the server. 
    Rule breaking example: A random user comes and starts to insult everyone.
    The correct behaviour would be not to do that as it is not nice.

    Rule breaking example: A random user comes and starts to post random stuff that is not part of the current discussion.

    Don't impersonate someone.

    The correct behaviour would be not to do that as it will confuse people.
