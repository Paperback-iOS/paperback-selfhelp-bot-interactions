  title: "6. **Do not ping/DM anyone without a valid reason.**"
  description: |-
    Asking for support in DMs or pinging someone is not a valid reason.
    We will help you eventually and if we don't help you, open another thread.

    Rule breaking example: A random user is pinging/DM'ing people for support.
    The correct behaviour would be to use the #welcome channel and troubleshoot the problem first.
    If you can't troubleshoot the problem, open a support thread and wait to receive further support.
