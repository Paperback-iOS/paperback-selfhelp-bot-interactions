  title: "5. **Keep the conversations in their appropriate channels.**"
  description: |-
    Keeping a conversation in their respective channel helps everyone. 

    Example: A random user is asking support in the #games channel.

    The correct behavior would be to use the #welcome channel and troubleshoot the problem first.
    If you can't troubleshoot the problem, open a support thread.
