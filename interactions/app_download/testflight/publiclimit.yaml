    We're sorry to inform you that the public version of the app on TestFlight has reached its maximum capacity. This is due to the 10,000 tester limit enforced by Apple.

    We are working to increase this limit, but unfortunately, we cannot provide an ETA for when this will happen. We will announce when the limits reset and everyone will be notified in our announcement channel.

    However, there are other options to gain access to the beta version of the app. You can join our Patreon to get access to the beta track of the app, or sideload the app through AltStore.
